 // logic is that : //
  

  let us take an example take a array with worst case



  arr[6]={6,5,4,3,2,1};
  
  here size is 6 and we have to find the sorted array 

  1.we assume that the element at the index at i=0 is sorted 
  2. loop 1 start from i=1 and ends n-1 so that we get to know the array element for further sorting logic 
  3. loop 2 start from j=i+1 till j>=0 j-- this is because let say at round 
     1 : we compare i+1 so that 6>5 which shift the index as following 

     shift logic : 
     temp=arr[i];
     if(arr[j]>temp){
      arr[j+1]=arr[j];
     }
     else {
      break;
     }

     arr[j+1]=temp;
